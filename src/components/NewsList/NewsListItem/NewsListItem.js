                Hailing from the east coast, Cowardice debuted forcefully in 2016 and has enraptured ears with their distinctive sludge via several significant 
                releases in the intervening years. This most recent expulsion is the consequence of a long 
                conspiracy with diffuse black metallers and Glossolalia alumni, Grst. 
                The resulting block of music is a challengingly dour 40 minutes worthy of its state-spanning 
                efforts.
